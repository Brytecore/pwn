				<h3>No bloat. More breakpoints. Any screen size.</h3>
				<p>
					Pwn was designed based on our need for a stable, consistent framework to use in our
					website themes and admin pages. After adding hundreds of styles to simply "remove" existing
					styles in large frameworks, we went looking for a smaller footprint in our base CSS. We found
					plenty of skeletal frameworks, but they had too "few" features (like not enough breakpoints
					for modern devices) or were too rigid.
				</p>
				<p>
					Pwn is perfect for our needs, and we decided to share our work with you, via permissive open
					source licensing. Enjoy!
